These are a collection of C++ library for interfacing the TE MEAS Weather Station Raspberry Pi hat with MCP2221 USB to UART/Ia2C bridge chip. The libraries are ported from Arduin libraries developed by TE, the original libraries can be found here: https://github.com/TEConnectivity

The four sensors aboard the MEAS weather station Pi hat are:
- TSD305-1C55 contactless IR temperature and ambient temperature sensor.
- HTU21D temperature and humidity sensor.
- MS5637 pressure and temperature sensor.
- TSYS01 temperature sensor.
