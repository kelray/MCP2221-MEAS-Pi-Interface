# MCP2221 Library for TE MEAS Weather Station Raspberry Pi Hat
This is a port of Arduino libraries for the TE MEAS Weather Station Raspberry Pi hat for MCP2221 USB to UART/Ia2C bridge chip. It interfaces the four sensors on-board via I2C. The four sensors are:
- TSD305-1C55 contactless IR temperature and ambient temperature sensor.
- HTU21D temperature and humidity sensor.
- MS5637 pressure and temperature sensor.
- TSYS01 temperature sensor.
